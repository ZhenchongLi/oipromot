# OiPromot Functions List

## Project Overview
OfficeAI User End Prompt Project - A FastAPI application with LangChain integration for AI-powered prompt processing.

## Functions & Requirements

### 1. Prompt Optimization using AI

**Purpose:** Improve user prompts through AI-powered optimization to achieve more precise and effective results.

**Problem Statement:** 
Human natural language cannot describe requirements very precisely. Users often struggle to articulate exactly what they want to achieve with their prompts, leading to suboptimal AI responses.

**Solution:**
Use AI to help users refine and optimize their prompts by:
- Analyzing the user's initial prompt
- Identifying ambiguities or unclear parts
- Suggesting improvements for clarity and precision
- Helping users confirm the intended meaning
- Iteratively refining the prompt until it accurately captures the user's intent

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered prompt analysis
- Suggestion generation for prompt improvements
- Interactive refinement process
- Confirmation mechanism to ensure user intent is captured
- Iterative optimization workflow

### 2. Prompt Storage and Tracking

**Purpose:** Save optimized prompts to database for effectiveness tracking and validation in OfficeAI product integration.

**Problem Statement:** 
Need to track which prompts work effectively in the actual OfficeAI product environment to validate optimization quality and build a knowledge base of successful prompts.

**Solution:**
Store all prompt optimization sessions and results in the database to:
- Track original vs optimized prompts
- Monitor performance metrics when used in OfficeAI
- Build a repository of effective prompts
- Analyze patterns in successful optimizations
- Provide feedback loop for continuous improvement

**Key Features:**
- Database storage for prompt optimization sessions
- Version tracking (original â†’ optimized versions)
- Performance metrics collection
- Integration status tracking with OfficeAI
- Success/failure feedback mechanism
- Historical analysis and reporting
- Prompt effectiveness scoring
